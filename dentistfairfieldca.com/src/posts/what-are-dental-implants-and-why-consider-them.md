If you’re missing one or more teeth, you might be looking into dental implants as a solution. Dental implants are artificial, or man-made teeth that are surgically implanted into your jawbone.  They have number of advantages over other tooth replacement options like dentures or bridges.

First, let’s define what they are. Dental implants are artificial teeth that are made to look, feel, and be used just as your natural teeth do. They consist of three main parts:

* The implant: A small metal post that’s placed in your jawbone.
* The abutment: A connector that’s put on top of the implant and serves as a base layer for the crown or artificial tooth.
* The crown or artificial tooth: This is the part of the dental implant that resembles the natural tooth and is seen above the gum line.

Why might you need dental implants?

There are several reasons why you might need dental implants. Some of the most common reasons include:

* Missing teeth: Dental implants are a great way to replace one or more missing teeth, improving  eating, speaking , and smiling!
* Tooth decay or injury: If you have a tooth that’s badly  injured or decaying, your dentist may suggest a dental implant to replace it.
* Gum disease: Gum disease that has progressed enough can lead to tooth loss. Dental implants can be an effective solution for replacing teeth missing from gum disease.
* Cosmetic reasons: If you’re unhappy with the appearance of your teeth or smile, dental implants can be used to improve the aesthetics of your mouth  and smile.

How do dental implants work?

Dental implants  replace the root of a missing tooth with a metal post that is used as a foundation for the artificial tooth. The implant is made of titanium or another biocompatible material that’s able to fuse with your jawbone. This creates a strong and base for the artificial tooth, or implant. 

How to get a dental Implant: 

First, your dentist will examine your mouth and jaw to see if you’re a good fit for dental implants. If you are, they’ll take x-rays and impressions of your teeth and gums to create a treatment plan unique to you.

Next, the implant will be placed into your jawbone. This process typically takes several weeks to months to allow the implant to fuse with your jawbone and create a strong foundation for the artificial tooth.

Once the implant has fused with your jawbone, your dentist will attach the abutment to the implant. Finally, artificial tooth, or dental implant will be attached to the abutment, completing the dental implant process.

Dental implants offer a number of benefits over other alternative tooth replacements. They’re long-lasting, easy to care for, and durable. Plus they look and feel like your normal teeth. If you’re considering dental implants, talk to your dentist to learn more about the process and find out if they’re right for you.
