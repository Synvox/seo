**Quick Tips for avoiding Tooth Decay:**

- Fluoride supplements or fluoridated municipal water can be helpful in maintaining the mineral balance in the enamel. Even more available and easy to use are fluoride rinses and toothpastes, which can be easily worked into your daily dental care routine.
- Many acidic foods will rapidly degrade the tooth when left on the surface for long periods of time. Be sure to clean acidic and sugary food off your teeth, especially right before going to bed.
- Brushing your teeth two times a day is critical for good gum and mouth health. Before sleeping, pay extra attention to cleaning your teeth well.
- Chewing sugarless gum after a meal or snack can be beneficial in removing bits of food and sugars from the surface of the teeth. The physical action of chewing gum after a meal stimulates saliva production and scrapes the gums and teeth clean of small food particles.
