If a tooth has any history of decay it is more susceptible to break after a fall, a blow to the face, or a bite down onto something hard. A broken tooth can range in severity but you should see your dentist as soon as possible in any case. If you don’t have a dentist take care of the broken tooth it may become infected and you could possibly lose your tooth in the end. Here are some things you can do if you break a tooth to ensure proper care before it can be seen by a dentist:

1. _Take a Pain Reliever._ Acetaminophen or any other over the counter pain relievers can help your pain to subside while you cope with the discomfort of the broken tooth. You may also want to apply oral numbing gel to the area if a large part of your mouth is painful or uncomfortable.
2. _Rinse with Salt Water._ The salt water mouthwash tip has been passed down across generations because it kills bacteria and helps to cut down on the pain. Be especially careful when you spit and swish, though. Be gentle and swish with warm water for a more comfortable rinse.
3. _Cover the Tooth._ If the broken tooth is jagged or sharp you should cover it with a piece of wax paraffin or sugarless gum. This will ensure that it doesn’t cut your tongue, lip, or cheek on the sharp side.
4. _Eat Soft Foods._ Until the issue is resolved you must only eat soft foods. Chew on the other side of your mouth and swish after eating so that you can avoid the buildup of food and bacteria in the broken area.
