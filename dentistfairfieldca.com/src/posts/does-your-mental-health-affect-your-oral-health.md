The two may not seem like they have any similarities or connections, but there is more brewing under the surface than you might think.\
For those that have depression, anxiety, or any other mental health hardship, stress if often present in everyday life. When stress is abundant, the hormone cortisol levels are higher than what is considered average or normal. While cortisol is good in the normal regulation, with abundant levels, it can do more harm than good. It’s been proven to weaken the immune system, leaving people more vulnerable to disease and conditions in the mouth, like gingivitis and periodontitis.\
Another connection is that those that have higher stress, depression, and/or anxiety may have a harder time focusing on things that don’t feel important in the moment, like oral health.\
People with depression may only brush once in a while and/or skip the semi-annual cleaning and other dentist appointments, leading to even more oral problems. In addition, there are some medications out there that can cause complications like dry mouth, leaving food harder to get out and increasing cavity risk. Some with severe anxiety are more subject to this, canker sores, or even teeth grinding.\
