Does the average couple in American couple brush their teeth at the same time everyday? According the the Oral Health Foundationâ€™s Twitter account, 50% of couples never brush at the same time. 22% occasionally do, 17% most of the time, and 11% all the time.

That means only 1 in 4 regularly brush together, while half never do! Consider brushing next to each other. Practice non-verbal communication, crack a joke, and then seal it with a kiss!

This can establish an everyday cycle, or routine, which helps you and your significant other remember to actually brush! It helps encourage good oral health patterns. Good oral health keeps your breath fresh, your teeth white, and mouth all together healthy!

Love your partner, love your teeth!
