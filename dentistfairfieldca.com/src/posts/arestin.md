**Periodontal disease** is a serious infection under your gumline.

**ARESTIN**® (minocycline hydrochloride) is an antibiotic that kills the bacteria that cause the infection.

- It's placed directly in the infected areas—or "pockets"—in your gums.
- It's applied right after scaling and root planing, the dental procedure that disrupts stubborn plaque and bacteria below your gumline
- where brushing and flossing can't reach.

**ARESTIN**® starts working quickly, right at the source of infection, and keeps fighting bacteria long after you leave the dental office.\[1,2\]

**ARESTIN**® fights infection and inflammation for 30 days,2 and provides significantly better results than SRP alone for up to 90 days.\[3\]
