COVID-19 Update
Based on California Gov. Gavin Newsom’ mandate on March 19, 2020, all dental offices in this state are only permitted to see patients who are experiencing a true dental emergency until further notice.

These “emergencies” are defined as someone experiencing pain or swelling. The spirit of this mandate is to prevent further spread of the virus and to alleviate additional burden on our hospital healthcare system.

If you are someone that fits into this category and are not currently sick or have not traveled outside of the country, we are able to see you. Please reach out to us immediately and we’ll do our best to accommodate you.

In addition, we can also provide virtual appointments if you are not able to come in for an emergency.

As always, our main priority is the health and safety of our patients and our team members, and we are doing everything we can to help stop the spread of the coronavirus while remaining dedicated to our patients’ dental health.
Should you need to reach us during this time, the best ways to contact us include:
