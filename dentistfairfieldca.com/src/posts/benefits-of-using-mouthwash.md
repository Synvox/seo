Who wants to add one more thing to their everyday oral routine? No one really wants to, but this blog post hopefully will sell you on using mouthwash regularly.
Pros of mouthwash include:

1. Canker sores: yes is hurts to use mouthwash when you have a canker sore, but it is because it is detoxifying that area! The rinse reduces the number of bacteria that can bother the sore. After a few days of rinsing with mouthwash, the canker sore should feel better and be reduced.
2. Gum Disease Warrior: Antibacterial mouthwash can help your mouth with periodontal disease, or gum disease. It helps to kill off germs and bacteria that cause these problems, and some of them even add protection throughout the day.
3. Cavity Protectant: Some of us may feel like we always have a cavity when we go to the dentist. It’s so embarrassing! Consider using a mouthwash with fluoride in it. Rinsing your mouth with fluoride (not swallowing it!) can be a protectant from cavities and tooth decay.

These are only a few of the good things mouthwash does, apart from helping your breath smell better! Rinsing everyday or so can help keep the bad bacteria away that comes from easting and chewing food. However, don’t think this can replace brushing and flossing! It is there for added protection and health benefits, not to take away brushing your teeth, sorry for the bad news!

A few good mouthwashes approved by the ADA (American Dental Association) are:

1. Listerine Total Care Zero Anti-cavity Mouthwash
2. Listerine Smart Rinse
3. TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse
4. Listerine Gum Therapy
