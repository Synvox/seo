It might seem like a thing that doesn’t matter much because it’s cheap, but the toothbrush is a very intimate object that gets in touch with a very sensitive part of your body. It also ensures that you keep that part of your body healthy. Caring for your toothbrush is extremly important if you want to ensure that when you brush you won’t fill your mouth with harmful bacteria.[![Taking-Care-of-Your-Toothbrush-image](/images/Taking-Care-of-Your-Toothbrush-image-300x231.jpg)](/images/Taking-Care-of-Your-Toothbrush-image.jpg)

One of the first things that you need to know is that toothbrushes shouldn’t be stored in dark places. Bacteria grows in the dark, and it loves moist spaces. Since the inside of the medicine cabinet is dark, it’s a great way to get it filled with bacteria.

So, if you can’t store your toothbrush in your bathroom where it’s dark and moist, where should you store it? Anywhere else!

At the same time, it’s important to keep your toothbrush away from other toothbrushes. We get easily infected with diseases, and a great way to get infected is using a bacteria-fllled toothbrush. Keeping toothbrushes separately and away from each other is the best thing you can do for your teeth's health and your health in general.

You want to make sure that after you finish brushing that you clean your toothbrush under running water. However, don’t dry it by wiping it on a towel or paper. Let it air out to dry. Also, make sure it’s in a upright position and remember to store it as far away from your bathroom as possible.

Another thing that you need to know is that you need to replace your toothbrush every three to four months. Even if it looks good it has lived its life. It is teeming with bacteria and is not as effective as a brand new one. So you may as well replace it. If you’re prone to forget, then set a reminder on your computer or telephone.

These simple steps will ensure that your teeth and the rest of your body stays healthy.
