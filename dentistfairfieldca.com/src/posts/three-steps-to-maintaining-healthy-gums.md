The first thing you can do to maintain healthy gum tissue is also the most important.  As you may have guessed, brushing and flossing are the top things you can so to help your gums.  But just as important as whether or not you brush and floss is _how_ you brush and floss.  Choosing a soft-bristled brush is best, so as not to irritate the gum tissue.  Next, placing the brush at a 45-degree angle at the gum line and gently brushing removes bacteria closest to the roots and helps prevent gum disease.

Flossing is done by dispensing at least 18 inches of floss.  Using a clean spot of floss between every pair of teeth and holding it in a U-shape, gently floss just underneath the gumline.  Not only does this remove plaque, food debris, and bacteria, but it also physically stimulates the circulation in the tissues.

Second,  there is no substitute for regular visits to your dentist when it comes to taking care of your gums.  Your dentist is specially trained to spot problems early in your mouth, including your gums.  In particular, oral cancer screenings, such as the ones done in the office of Dr. Warner, DDS, in Fairfield, CA, are especially beneficial.  Besides, your dentist can point out places that you might be missing in the care of your gums.  Having your teeth professionally cleaned during your visit helps to remove plaque that may have accumulated near the gumline.

The third and final step is to avoid tobacco at all costs.  This is not just confined to a warning about smoking cigarettes.  Even chewing tobacco and e-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the body which can reduce blood supply to the gum tissue and mask symptoms of gum disease.  This is very serious because if not caught early, gum disease can lead to tooth loss and other more harmful conditions.

So there you have it!  Three steps to keeping your gums healthy and your smile happy.  I think it is safe to apply the old saying here: Take care of your gums and they will take care of you.
