This week houses one of our favorite national holidays- National Dentist Day! It lands on March 6th every year. If you see Dr. Warner- wish him a happy day!

National Dentist Day doesn't have a clear reason for being on March 6th, but it is thought that it falls on this day because in 1790, American dentist John Greenwood (who served President George Washington  as his personal dentist) invented the first dental drill powered by a foot engine. 

The first mention of dentistry we know of from history is around 7000 B.C. in the Indus Valley Civilization. There are records from continuing on discussing topics such as decaying teeth. The first book completely about dentistry was called "The Little Medicinal Book For All Kinds of Diseases and Infirmities of the Teeth" published in 1530!

In the 1700s dentists were becoming more of a defined and specialized profession. In 1723, Pierre Fauchard from France was credited as the Father of Modern Dentistry.

Why should you care about this day? It's for us as patients and staff to show gratitude for all the hard work Dr. Warner and other dentist's do all year long. They keep your teeth healthy, strong and looking bright. Dentist's help you to feel confident with your own mouth and know more about your oral health. What's not to be thankful for?!
