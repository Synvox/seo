Babies- they come in all sizes! They also teeth at different ages too. Most start growing teeth around 6 months, but it is considered normal anywhere between 3-12 months. Some signs and symptoms of teething include but are not limited to:

Mild fever

Increased drooling

Runny nose

decreased appetite for solid foods

Increased chewing and biting

Sucking

Irritability

(If your baby ever has a fever above 102 call the doctor or go to the ER)

It can be a challenging time for both babies and parents. So let’s discuss a few tricks of the trade.

1. Cold things. Try freezing a pacifier or toy, frozen milk popsicles, chilled fruit, or even a cold washcloth. The cold can soothe sore gums.

2. Massage their gums! Our let them chew on one or two of your fingers. Chewing can help counteract the pressure of growing teeth!

3. Wipe away the extra drool. This drooling comes with this stage. As they grow teeth, the drool increases. The hard part is that the drool can irritate the face and sometimes causes a rash. Keep those cheeks clean!

4. Pain medication. This can be used as a last resort if nothing soothes that poor baby! Always consult with your pediatrician for the correct dosage.

And remember it’s not forever that they are like this!
