This February’s National Children’s Dental Health Month was dedicated to the 75th anniversary of community water fluoridation. These years of research have shown that fluoride in water is safe and its works. The ADA President Chad P. Gahani said, “It also prevents tooth decay by at least 25% in both children and adults.”

By drinking water you can take a precaution against cavities. Not all cities have fluoride in their water, so if you don’t, make sure you use toothpastes and/or mouthwashes that have it in them. Check your water supply or your local government listings.

Fluoride in water sometimes gets a bad reputation because people think it will poison them. the dosage is what is important. As long as it .7 milligrams per liter or more, then it is perfectly healthy and recommended!
