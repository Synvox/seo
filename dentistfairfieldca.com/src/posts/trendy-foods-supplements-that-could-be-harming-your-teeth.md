There have been lots of foods and drinks in our news feeds for the past couple years. Anywhere from super foods, to super drinks that claim they do wonders for your health. While some may have good benefits for the body, others actually could be doing bad things to your mouth and teeth.

Kombucha is a fermented tea that contains tons of antioxidants and probiotics that help with gut health and have great inflammation reducing qualities. With these benefits aside, it also is a very acidic. With water being a neutral pH of 7, kombucha has to be kept under a pH of 3.5 to stop harmful bacteria from growing in it. Anything below 7 is considered acidic. Acidic foods and drinks can cause great enamel erosion (the white outside part of your teeth), which is not good!

Turmeric is a spice that has been shown to have great anti-inflammatory properties as well. It has a lot of antioxidants and can also be great for gut health. One drawback is that is can yellow your teeth over time, (yuck!) . If you want to continue to use this healthy spice, it is recommended that you rinse your mouth and even brush your teeth after consumption, to help get the color and residue off.

The last one we are going to discuss today is gummy vitamins. As kids we were always told to eat them daily, and that they were good for us! While they are good because of what is in them, the gummy side of the market has its downfalls. They taste better than the pills because of the sugar in them. The added sugar can be a risk for cavities and the sticky factor makes it really hard to get them off your teeth, leaving them to saturate your mouth with sugar. If the gummy part is worth it to you, (it is to me!), then remember to rinse your mouth with water after eating them.
