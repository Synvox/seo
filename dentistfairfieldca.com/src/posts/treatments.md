Cleaning
PREVENTATIVE VISITS
Prevention is the best medicine. We recommend having your teeth cleaned with our hygienist and an exam with Dr. Warner every six months (or more often if necessary) so that if problems occur they can be spotted early.

_restorative dentistry_
Restorative dentist uses variety of materials, ceramics and polymers to recreate your smile and repair damaged teeth.   During many restorative dental procedures, your dentist will use a combination of different materials to ensure the effectiveness of restoration as a long term solution.
Restorative dentistry involves complete dental care and restoration of damaged teeth especially when it comes to repairing oral and dental tissues. In its broadest sense, restorative dentistry is any dental process that restores old teeth into new, more vibrant ones.
Restorative dentistry is a dental care including:

- Fillings

Dental Implants
_Dental implants_ have been used to replace teeth for over 30 years. _Dental implants_ are a long-term solution that allows your lost or damaged teeth to be replaced. _Dental implants_ are titanium alloy screws placed into the jawbone to take the place of missing teeth roots. Bone actually attaches to the implant after a few months. Once that happens a replacement tooth is able to be attached. _Implants_ can replace individual missing teeth or be used to support a removable _denture_.
