Teeth whitening has seen a huge growth in popularity over the past decade, especially in certain circles.  You don’t even have to be a celebrity to have perfect teeth.  However, the problem is that not all of us have pearly whites, and no matter how much we brush and clean, we can’t seem to get them as white and nice as we’d want them to be.

Of course, it’s hard having really white teeth when so many things can color and discolor teeth (those little shades of white that are appearing on your teeth are discolorations). So, what causes that? A number of factors like smoking, drinking colas, food, aging and let’s not forget, coffee.

The good news is that today, you have a myriad of solutions when it comes to teeth whitening. However, not all solutions work for everybody. While the teeth that are discolored yellow, orange or brown respond quite well to cosmetic tooth whitening, the grey stains that are caused by tetracycline or heredity are quite hard to whiten. At the same time, people who have worn enamel or have sensitive teeth or periodontal disease can’t rely on teeth whitening. Why?

Because when it comes to teeth whitening, most systems use either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. Basically, when either one of these substances come into contact with the surface of the tooth, teeth whitening occurs.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that the best teeth whitening is the one that’s performed by a professional dentist.  They are uniquely qualified to identify the best products for the best results.  Not only that, but it is their job to make your smile as clean and bright as possible.

That does not mean that there are no teeth whitening products you can use at home.  The most common solutions include whitening gels, whitening strips, tray-based tooth whiteners.

Let’s take a look at how these work. The whitening gels are peroxide based, and are applied with a brush on your teeth, twice per day for two weeks.

Whitening strips are very thin strips that need to be applied two times per day for 30 minutes. The treatment shows results after the first couple of days and the effect last for about four months.

The tray-based tooth whiteners are the most effective solution, but are best overseen by a professional.  You will need to wear the tray for a couple of hours each day for about a month in order to see optimum results.
