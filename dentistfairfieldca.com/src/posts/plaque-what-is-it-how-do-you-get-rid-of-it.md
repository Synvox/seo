When you go to the dentist for a cleaning, there’s a lot of things happening inside your mouth. Some of which make sounds that make you nervous or uncomfortable. However they are needed to help keep teeth clean and healthy.  One of those scratchy noises is when plaque is being removed from your teeth by a specific tool. 


Plaque is a term we hear all the time at the dentist. But what is it really? Plaque is a a substance that attaches to teeth after you eat something. One small spot of plaque contains millions of bacteria (gross!). It becomes difficult to remove the longer it sits there because the bacteria excretes sticky substances so they can stay and eat the food on your teeth longer. The longer plaque stays on teeth, the longer that bacteria eats away your teeth (again, gross!). 


Brushing your teeth twice daily and flossing only get a portion of that plaque, so it’s essential to come into the office every six months and get it removed by the professionals. Every six months the dentist cleans away the built up plaque and makes sure your teeth are healthy. The tool used is a little more aggressive than the average toothbrush but doesn’t hurt you in any way. 


Just think about it next time you’re considering postponing a cleaning.. that plaque is eating away inside your mouth and the longer it’s their, the harder it is to get off in the long run! And it’s gross!
