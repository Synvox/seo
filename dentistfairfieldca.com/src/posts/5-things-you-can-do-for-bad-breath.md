If you don’t take care of it, it could lead to serious problems like halitosis and gingivitis.

The first thing that you need to keep in mind is that getting rid of bad breath is a long process. You need to understand that the best way to get rid of this problem is to go to your dentist and ask for help.  The good news is that there are some simple steps that you can take in order to make your breath smell nicer and minimize a number of problems. And they don’t cost you a dime!

1. Remove all leftover food in your teeth, because this is the #1 cause of foul mouth odor. It’s always easy to find and use a toothpick. Carrying dental floss with you at all times is also a good way to remove the food between your teeth.
2. Use warm water to gargle. This stops bad breath almost instantly, as a dry mouth is also a main cause of foul odor. Warm water works well to wet your mouth and reduce the chances of bacteria spreading in your mouth. Adding a bit of salt makes it an even more efficient solution.
3. Baking soda may also be used to eliminate unpleasant mouth odor. Mixing toothpaste with baking soda is a great solution.
4. Chewing gum is great because it not only stops bad breath but also ensures that you will activate your salivary glands, which will help to keep your mouth moist (see #2 above).
5. Eat fruits and vegetables, especially carrots and celery. These wash away bad breath instantly, as they are filled with vitamins and minerals.

Follow the above tips to free yourself from bad breath, but make sure that you visit your dentist regularly, especially if the tips above do not resolve the issue.  Abscesses, dental caries, and gum disease are serious problems that will not go away by rinsing with mouthwash.  As the old saying goes it’s always to be safe than sorry.  Stay on the safe side, and don’t skip and dentist appointments.  And don’t be afraid to go to the dentist each time you have a problem with your teeth or gums.
