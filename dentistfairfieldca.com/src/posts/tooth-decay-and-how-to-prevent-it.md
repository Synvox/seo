**Quick Tips for avoiding Tooth Decay:**

- Fluoride supplements or fluoridated municipal water can be very beneficial in maintaining the mineralization of the enamel. Even more quick and simple to use are fluoride rinses and toothpastes, which can be easily worked into your daily dental care routine.
- Many acidic foods can rapidly degrade the tooth when left in the plaque for extended periods of time. Make sure to clean sugary and acidic food off your teeth, especially right before sleeping.
- Brushing your teeth two times a day is essential for your mouth and gum health. Before going to bed, pay special attention to cleaning your teeth well.
- Chewing sugarless gum after a meal or snack can be beneficial in removing bits of food and sugars from the surface of your teeth. The physical action of chewing gum after a meal stimulates saliva production and scrapes the teeth and gums clean of small food particles.
