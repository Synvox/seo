![](/images/dentist-fairfield-ca-pregnancy-part-3-1024x683.jpeg)Everyone knows that pregnant women can't get enough of pickles and ice cream. And that 7 Layer Burrito from Taco Bell? Forget about it. What you really need to know, is that food cravings during pregnancy can increase your risk of tooth decay. Try to avoid giving in to sugary treats that will not only be food for bacteria but will also elevate your blood sugar. Instead, try to satisfy your cravings with something healthier such as whole fresh fruit.

Now that you know the foods NOT to eat, here are some things you will need to make sure you get lots of. Foods high in calcium such as milk, cheese, unsweetened yogurt, and calcium-fortified soymilk will help meet the nutritional needs of your baby. Also, increasing your calcium will protect your bone mass at a time when you need it the most.

While you are increasing your calcium intake, you also need to make sure you are getting enough vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for the efficient absorption of calcium. Adding foods like cheese, fortified margarine, fatty fish such as salmon, eggs, and mushrooms will give you an abundant supply.

Taking care of your teeth is never more important than when you are pregnant. If your teeth get what they need, your body will also, and so will your baby.
