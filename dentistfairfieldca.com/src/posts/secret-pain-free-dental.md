Fear of the dentist is common and an unfortunate condition that keeps many people from obtaining proper dental care. This fear may have been handed down from an older relative who had a bad experience many, many decades ago. Sometimes people develop this fear from watching a movie or hearing a story or having a friend share a very unlikely experience that he or she may have had. Whatever the case may be, you absolutely can and should have a pain-free visit to your dentist. Take a look at this video for our number one secret on how to accomplish that.

What you can feel completely confident about is that the overwhelming number of people who feel any level of anxiety over visiting the dentist do so because of a misconception. In truth Mark J.
