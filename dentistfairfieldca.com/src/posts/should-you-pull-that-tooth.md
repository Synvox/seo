If you're reading this, you may have a tooth (or teeth) that are in pain or bothering you. You may want to just end it and pull it out. But should you go for that choice automatically? Here are some reasons to help you decide to pull that tooth or try to keep it. 



1. Your original, or natural, teeth are stronger. They were made by you, even the strong artificial materials don't compare. 

2. Your original teeth are easier to care for. Again, they are natural, so all you need to worry about in general is basic oral health.

3. Your natural teeth function better than the implant you may get. 

4. When you pull a tooth, you risk the rest of your mouth shifting because there is room to do so.  This may not seem that bad, but it can eventually cause problems with chewing, eating, and biting. These problems can create a domino effect of pain, poor nutrition, and reduced quality of life.

5. Pulling teeth can make you look older. Weird, right? When a tooth is extracted from the mouth, it also pulls the roots that support the jaw. This allows bones to collapse and make your appearance not as youthful. 

There are many more reasons to try to save a tooth, but let's talk briefly about why it could be better to remove one. 

1. If your tooth is damaged beyond repair, it would be better to replace it, so it can function better. 

2. If a tooth is cracked below the gum-line, or in more than one spot your dentist will likely suggest an extraction. 

If they do want to extract, see if they can do a root canal instead. Sometimes it is possible, and that way you can keep your tooth/teeth!
