**3. What causes tooth cavities?**

Tooth cavities or dental caries is caused by acid produced as a waste product by the bacteria that live in the mouth. These bacteria produce more acid when there are more sugary foods present. We can't completely get rid oral bacteria but we can control the amount by regular and through cleaning, with brush, floss, and antibacterial rinses.

**4. What causes tooth loss?**

Tooth loss can be caused by several different things, trauma, decay, and loss of supporting tissues. The most common way that teeth are lost is due to periodontal disease which infects the gums and bone. This infection causes the bone that holds the teeth in to dissolve and then the tooth becomes loose and eventually can fall out. Once again this is a disease that can be prevented with good oral hygiene, and being check by your dentist regularly.

**5. How can dental cavities be prevented?**

Fortunately there are several things that can be done to prevent dental cavities. First and foremost being sure to clean the teeth with thorough and regular brushing and flossing will do the most to prevent cavities from developing. Also, teeth can be sealed on the chewing surface to prevent decay from entering the tooth through the grooves that are difficult to clean. Fluoride is also used in the drinking water and in tooth pastes to help strengthen tooth enamel.
