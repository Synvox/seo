Dr. Warner grew up with dentistry. His father James Warner was a practicing dentist in Fairfield from 1967 until 1999. As Dr. Warner was born during his father’s dental school freshman year finals you might say that dentistry is in his DNA. Dr. Warner attended the Medical College of Virginia School of Dentistry from 1989 – 1993. He moved home to Fairfield upon graduation and worked for his father for several years before buying the practice. Dr. Warner enjoys getting to know so many wonderful people and serving them by helping them to be healthy and happy with their appearance.

When not practicing dentistry, Dr. Warner enjoys time with his family, especially his two adorable grandsons. He is the proud father of four children and has been happily married to his wife Kristin for 32 years this month. Kristin is currently the practice office manager and is fantastic at it.

Dr. Warner has spent much time in service in his church, The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He has worked with youth in our community for many years and is now serving as the bishop of his congregation.

Dr. Warner loves to be active out of doors. He spends a lot of time on his road bike touring around the local back roads. So, please be nice to the bikers, you never know if it might be your dentist out there. He also enjoys running, swimming, hiking, and anything in the water.
