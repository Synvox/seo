The next class of causes have to do with trauma or injury to the delicate tissues of your mouth. The inside of the mouth is a sensitive area. Injury to the tissue on the roof of the mouth can lead to a bump forming.

One type of injury that can cause a bump is a burn. Burns commonly occur when hot beverages, such as coffee or tea, or foods that have just finished cooking come in contact with your mouth. They can also occur if you swallow fire on a regular basis, as pictured above.

If the burn is severe enough, a bump or blister can form. However, it still may be considered minor enough to heal on its own, as long as you take care to avoid irritating the sensitive skin.

Other types of injuries that may lead to the formation of a bump on the roof of yourmouth are:

- puncture wounds
- cuts
- damage to the mouth from tobacco use
- accidents from dental work
- irritation from dentures

Any of these types of injuries may cause scar tissue to form in the mouth. That scar tissue is likely to be lumpy and raised. Even if the sore is painful or sensitive, but it will usually heal without treatment. Warm salt water used as a rinse may help promote healing and be soothing to the irritated area.
