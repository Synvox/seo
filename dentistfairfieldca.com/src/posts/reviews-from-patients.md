Have you ever wondered what other patients have to say about Dr. Warner and his practice? Well wonder no more! Here a just a few things some patients wanted to share about our office! We hope this helps you feel more confident in us and/or decide to try us out! You won't be disappointed. 

Dr. Warner made my all time dentist list when my then 10 yr old daughter fell on her roller blades and broke off half of her front tooth. He came in during off hours and magically glued it back together. Let’s fast forward and that now 25 yrs old daughter is working in DC as. Health consultant and goes in for a dental exam. That dentist marveled at work that Dr. Warner had done 15 years ago and called the other dentists to see his work. He has done work on my teeth that showed his great artistry and skill. In replacing caps and crowns that matched the exact color as adjoining teeth. He really does care about appearances and comfort. I highly recommend Dr. Warner. He is Fairfield’s best. He’s a great guy too.

I highly recommend Dr. Warner, he is by far the best dentist I have ever had. Absolutely pain free and I had all teeth removed for full dentures. He was very patient and worked at a pace I was comfortable with. His staff are all incredibly friendly and professional. If your looking for a great dentist give Dr. Warners office a call, you won’t be disappointed. -Robert C. 

Dr Warner just fixed my smile! I could tell he did it with great skill and care. He was gentle and efficient. So grateful to have my smile look so much better. I’ve had spaces and gaps between my front teeth for years and years. In one sitting he filled them in, almost like magic! He didn’t up sell me to crowns or veneers. This preserves my natural tooth structure and kept my tooth healthy. Not to mentioned saved me thousands of dollars!!!$$$$ Thank You!!!!!!!! -Doug W. 

I had retired 3 Dentist here in Fairfield and had to find another Dentist that was local. my friend suggested Dr. Mark Warner located on Oliver Road. I find the staff here to be very friendly and personable every time I visit the office. Dr. Warner is easy to chat with and listens to my questions and requests. He explains everything where I understand and asks if I have any questions or concerns. Great atmosphere! I just completed an implant and I am very happy with my outcome. Thanks Dr. Warner! -Frani D. 

Dr. Warner has been my dentist for along time. Recently, I developed some nerve pain in a crown that I had. Living with the pain for a few days, the pain got so bad I called Dr. Warner for an appointment to get rid of the pain. He gave me an emergency appointment and came in at 5 pm that same day. I had an emergency root canal. Dr. Warner was a godsend. After having pain for so long, it was so GREAT to be able to drink coffee again. Thank you Dr. Warner!!! -Glenn S.
