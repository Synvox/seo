![](/images/large_dentures-transparent-300x149.png)George Washington suffered with problems with his teeth all his adult life, with his first tooth being pulled at the age of 24.  He had several sets of false teeth, but contrary to popular belief, none of them were fashioned from wood (some would argue that they looked like they were).  Various materials were used, including ivory, hippopotamus bone, and even his own previously pulled teeth.  For more about our illustrious first president and his denture adventure, read the article at [Mount Vernon.org](http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/wooden-teeth-myth/).
