A new review of studies conducted by researchers at the Univerity of Washington shows that brushing without fluoride does not help prevent cavities.  Even flossing by itself will not do the trick.  According to these researchers, toothpaste must be used that contains fluoride.

Most toothpastes on the market today contain fluoride.  So why the big commotion?  There are a lot of natural health advocates that say that fluoride does more harm than good.  And some natural toothpaste brands make do not include it in their formulas.

Apparently, it is not enough to just remove the plaque from your teeth.  That includes flossing.  Dental authorities maintain that the addition of fluorides can help protect your teeth from decay.![](/images/dentist-fairfield-ca-fluoride-toothpaste-1024x588.jpg)
