There are a few different types of dentistry out there. Dr. Warner does general and cosmetic dentistry as his main treatments. Cosmetic dentistry focuses on making your smile and teeth look different and improved.  It’s different from general dentistry, in the way that general dentistry is more concerned with keeping your teeth and gums healthy. There are many different cosmetic dental procedures that can help improve the way your teeth look. 

Here are some reasons cosmetic dentistry may be right for you.

1. Confidence in Your Smile Cosmetic dentistry can make you feel better about your physical appearance  by improving the way your teeth actually look. If you’re embarrassed about your smile or feel self-conscious about a certain tooth, cosmetic dental treatments can help you feel more comfortable  and confident  when out and about. When you have a beautiful, healthy-looking smile, you’re more likely to smile more often and feel good about yourself.  Smiling more can actually help you feel happier too!


2. Fix Dental Problems Cosmetic dentistry can fix many different dental problems, like chipped, missing, or misshapen teeth.  Veneers are just one example. They are thin covers that go on the front of your teeth to make them look better. Teeth whitening is another. It can help get rid of stains and make your teeth look cleaner and brighter. 


3. Improving  Health Cosmetic dentistry can also improve your oral health. Some procedures can straighten crooked teeth and keep them straight, which helps keep your mouth healthy and your teeth from moving and injuring your jaw. . For example, dental implants can keep your teeth from moving and stop your jawbone from getting weaker.


4. Results That Last Most cosmetic dental treatments can last a long time if you’re good at keeping your oral health a priority . Veneers, dental implants, and other cosmetic treatments can last for many years, so you can enjoy a beautiful smile for a long time.
