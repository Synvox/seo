Most of us have had at least one cavity in our lifetimes. Often times we have had a more than a few in our childhood (hello candy and sugar with not bushing our teeth well).  Cavities are damaged areas of our enamel. They develop into tiny holes in our teeth. Gross, right? 


Cavities can be caused by a few different things, but the main culprits are frequent sugary things being in our mouths and not cleaning our teeth/ mouthes well enough each day.  Others are not getting enough fluoride to strengthen the enamel and dry mouth, among others.  Sugar from food and drinks will turn into acid, which is what  causes the damage. 


If cavities are left without treatment, they can cause bigger holes in your teeth, leading to severe pain, infection, and possible loss of the affected tooth/teeth.

Some symptoms include:

* Toothaches that occur without a clear reason
* Sensitivity to hot, cold, and or sweet foods and drinks
* Staining on the surface of the tooth, often black or brown in color
* Pain when biting down or chewing

   It is important to go to the dentist regularly so that the they can check for cavities as well as other health problems in your mouth. You may not know you have a cavity, because they are so small or new. If you have pain or notice any of these symptoms, call our office immediately, so we can treat you and stop the damage as soon as possible.
