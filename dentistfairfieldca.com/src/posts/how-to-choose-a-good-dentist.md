What makes a dentist better than another? How should you pick him or her? Dentists, even if they all studied the same thing, are different. So, how can you pick the right one?

You might be tempted to say that filling a cavity isn’t as complicated as brain surgery, but, still, it has to be done right. You wouldn’t go to get a flu shot from a person on the street, would you?

There are lots of things to be considered when choosing the right dentist. Some might want to pick a dentist with a nice personality because they can get along. However, you need to do a little bit of research first.

A great way to find a good dentist is by recommendation. A friend or your doctor could recommend a good dentist. Ask about insurance, personality, availability, satisfaction, convenience and so forth. Make sure that you know all of the above before scheduling a visit.

If you don’t think that the above can help, another useful tool is the internet. Simply look up local dentists in your area and check out their sites. Also, see what others have to say about them. There are forums and specialized sites that “review” doctors and dentists, and you can find lots of useful information this way.   Keep in mind that not all reviews are legitimate, however.  Some dental practices will actually pay people who are not even patients to leave positive feedback on these sites.  Others hire SEO companies whose practices include writing negative reviews about their client’s competitors.

Of course, you can’t be sure until you actually meet the person and see how he or she works. So, the best way to ensure yourself that you made the right choice is to schedule a check-up (most are free) and see how it goes from there. Don’t be shy about checking out several dentists until you find one that you like and you’re comfortable with.  At the same time, make sure that you ask around after your find one to ensure that he or she has a good reputation as a dental professional.
