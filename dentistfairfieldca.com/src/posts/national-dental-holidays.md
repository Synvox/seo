 National Dental Holidays With this New Year coming in full swing, there are lots of dates and important events to remember. There are birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, and many more. Days like Mother’s Day and Father’s Day are great examples of giving loved ones well- deserved appreciation and notice.  Other’s who deserve appreciation include teachers, doctors, and yes, your dentist! 
All year there are many days and weeks dedicated to oral health and dentist appreciation.
