Soda is a fizzy, delicious drink but it is strongly linked to tooth decay. Milk consumption has decreased and fizzy soda pop and sugary juices have risen to take its place. This can lead to bad habits and more kids than ever are being treated for tooth decay due to constant soda drinking. The sugars in the soda combine with the bacteria in your mouth to form acid which can damage teeth. Kids and teens are especially susceptible to tooth decay because their tooth enamel is not fully developed.[![Minimizing-Tooth-Decay-from-Fizzy Soda-image](/images/Minimizing-Tooth-Decay-from-Fizzy-Soda-image-224x300.jpg)](/images/Minimizing-Tooth-Decay-from-Fizzy-Soda-image.jpg)

Eating at least two servings of dairy every day is a good way to combat this tooth decay. The calcium and proteins build strength back into your teeth so that they are less susceptible to tooth decay. Milk is an especially easy way to get into the habit of consuming dairy consistently. Swapping a glass of milk for even one soda a week or day is a good way to build up good habits.

Drinking your soda out of a straw can keep more of the sugar away from your teeth. If you don’t have a straw be certain that you’re not sloshing the soda around in your mouth. Because the acid can stay in your mouth for up to 20 minutes after each sip you should swish your mouth out with water after drinking or brush your teeth to dilute the acid.

Limiting the sugary beverages is one clear way to save your teeth from serious tooth decay. Swapping drinks for healthier, less sugary and acidic ones, like water or milk can be difficult when you’re craving a sweet drink but it is better in the long run. Plus, healthier drinks actually keep your body hydrated while sugary drinks can speed up dehydration. It’s okay to drink soda in moderation but too much can have serious effects on your oral health.
