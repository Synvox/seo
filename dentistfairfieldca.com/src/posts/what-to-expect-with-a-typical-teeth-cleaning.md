![](/images/oral-cancer-protocol.jpg) Whether you’re a new patient or someone that hasn’t been to the dentist in a while, it is always helpful to know what goes on a teeth cleaning.

When you first check in and wait in the waiting room, you will be called back . The dental hygienist will bring you into the X-ray room and put a heavy coat on for you. They will take a few X-rays on each side of your mouth.

Once they sit you back down in the dental chair, you’ll be flossed and cleaned from all the tartar/plaque. After that you’ll be polished with your choice of flavored polish. Once you’re cleaned, you will get fluoride put on your teeth, and you won’t be able to eat or drink for about 30 minutes. Once that is done, the dentist, Dr. Warner, will come and check on you and make sure all the X-rays are good. If a tooth happens to have a cavity, he will explain options for the next course of action, and make sure you are comfortable. He will go through any concerns he has and can answer any questions you may have. The entire staff is there to help you.

It’s as simple as that! There is not a thing to be nervous of, so make an appointment!
