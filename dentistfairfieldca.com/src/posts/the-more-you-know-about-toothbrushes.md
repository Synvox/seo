![toothbrushes for dentist fairfield](/images/knowing-about-toothbrushes-dentist-fairfield-ca-1024x682.jpeg)Did you know that it does not matter if you have a power toothbrush or a manual toothbrush—both have what it takes to get the job done? The important thing is to look for the ADA Seal of Acceptance on any toothbrush you are looking to purchase. This lets you know whether or not the brush has been independently tested and verified as safe and effective for your teeth.

Also, you should change your toothbrush every 3-4 months. Even though your dentist might give you a [new toothbrush](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/funny-reminder-to-change-your-toothbrush-every-six-months/) at each visit, the bristles on your toothbrush wear out before your next visit. A worn toothbrush won’t keep your teeth as clean. One way recommended by the American Dental Association to remember to change your brush every 3-4 months is new season, new toothbrush.

Most people do not know how much toothpaste they should actually be using. Adults and children age 3 and older should brush with a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste. Children younger than 3 should use a smear of fluoride toothpaste the size of a grain of rice. Brushing with too much toothpaste can damage enamel because children could swallow too much fluoride while their teeth are developing. That can cause dental fluorosis, white marks, and discoloration of teeth. As in toothbrushes, look for a toothpaste with the ADA Seal of Acceptance.

Always choose a soft-bristled brush. Firm or even medium-strength bristles may actually damage your gums and enamel. Because your fluoride toothpaste does most of the work, it is only necessary to only brush hard enough to clean the film off your teeth. In other words, don’t scrub your teeth.

You should brush your teeth at least twice a day. The best times to brush are when you wake up in the morning (before breakfast) and before you go to bed at night.

Keeping your mouth—and your body—in good health comes down to a few healthy habits. In addition to brushing two times a day with fluoride toothpaste, remember to clean between your teeth daily. The best way to do that is to floss. Eating a healthy diet and keeping sugary snacks and beverages to a minimum goes a long way to fight tooth decay, as well. And of course, you will want to keep up with your regular visits to the dentist.
