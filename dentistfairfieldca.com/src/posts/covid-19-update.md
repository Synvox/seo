A few new rules we are implementing are as follows:

We ask that when you come in for your appointment, please wear a mask. 

* If you have an illness or are exhibiting symptoms, we recommend you cancel and reschedule your dental appointment. Some illness and symptoms include:
        * severe headaches or body aches
	* a cold or the flu
	* fever or nausea
	* muscle or stomach pain, chest pain or difficulty breathing
	* vomiting or diarrhea
	* active tuberculosis (TB)
	* mumps, measles, chickenpox
	* other contagious disease
* Please notify us before your appointment if you or someone you are in close contact with have recently traveled to one of the countries with large outbreaks of COVID-19 (ex. China, Italy, Iran, South Korea), or if you have been exposed to someone else who was diagnosed with COVID-19 or who was quarantined as a precaution.

If you are healthy and feeling good, there is no need to reschedule, come on in! Don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions.
