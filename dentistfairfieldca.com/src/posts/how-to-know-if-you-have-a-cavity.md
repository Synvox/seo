Cavities are quite common, actually afflicting over 90% of the population, and are becoming more easily treatable. Cavities are holes in a tooth’s enamel and if small enough, they may remain unnoticed by the patient. However, if a cavity is left untreated for a period of time the tooth can become irritated by food that breeds bacterial toxins. Toothaches from cavities are the most common reason why people go to the dentist.

Your dentist can discover cavities for you and fill them before they become a bigger issue. Many cavities are not noticed by the patient until it is identified and treated by a dentist. If a cavity is large and painful you should visit the dentist immediately. You may notice that the toothache is especially painful after consuming hot, cold, sweet, or sour food or drink. Occasionally the holes or pits can be visible on the surface of the teeth in cases of extreme tooth decay.

Be aware of your usual chewing habits and note if you find that you make a switch. Sometimes it may not be obvious to you until you pay close attention.

The bacterial toxins from food stuck in your cavities can bring about bad breath. The release of this collection in your teeth can lead to continuously putrid breath. Blood on your toothbrush is possible if you have a cavity between two teeth. As the tooth decays on the gum line the decay actually can grow into the underlying gum tissue. Be aware of any changes in your mouth and note any pain or discomfort that you’re experiencing.
