You’d think bushing your teeth would be self explanatory, but let’s just cover the basics! First off, make sure you get a toothbrush that has bristles that are soft, so you don’t damage your teeth and gums.
Start by placing your toothbrush along the gum line so you can touch both teeth and gum.
Brush the outer teeth in a rolling motion of 2-3 teeth at a time. This motion helps to make contact both teeth and gums. Repeat on the inside.
Continue this until you have reached all the outer and inner tooth surfaces.
Tilt the toothbrush vertically and brush behind the front teeth.
Brush against the biting surfaces of the teeth in a scrubbing motion.
Brush the tongue
You are done! Now on to flossing!
