**Q: What got you into this specific practice of dentistry?**

**A:** I was introduced to dentistry by my father James Warner, who practiced dentistry in Fairfield for over 30 years. I got to spend time in the office observing what it was like to be a dentist. I still have patients that like to remind me that they knew me when I was just a little kid running around the office.  I think that the thing that really made me want to be a dentist, was seeing how my dad helped people.  I have really enjoyed having the opportunity to get to know the people I serve and helping them  to understand and take charge of their own oral health.

 

**Q: What landed you in your city, and what is it that you like about the neighborhood?**

**A:** I grew up in Fairfield. I went from kindergarten through high school here. I knew when I decided to become a dentist that I would come back to Fairfield to practice with my father and I am very happy with that decision. One of my favorite things about this area are the rolling hills, especially when they are green. I like to be a short drive form both the mountains and the beach, as well as close to Lake Berryessa where I love to wake board with my family.

 

**Q: Where did you receive your Undergraduate and Dental degrees?**

**A:** I did my undergraduate work at Brigham Young University in Utah and attended dental school at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond Virginia.

 

**Q: What are the most challenging parts of your every day practice?**

**A:** I think that the most challenging thing in every day practice is seeing the preventable damage that dental disease has done.

 

**Q: How many years have you been in practice and what are your office hours?**

**A:** I have been in practice for 17 years. Our office hours are Mon - Thurs.  9 - 5 and some Fridays.

 

**Q: What insurance does your practice accept?**

**A:** We take all standard insurance plans that let you choose your own dentist, including most Delta Dental plans and United Concordia.

 

**Q: What investments in your practice equipment and facilities have you made?**

**A:** We utilize digital photography and intra-oral cameras. Electric handpiece driven nickel titanium files for endodontics. Invisalign orthodontics.

 

**Q: What procedures do you feel your practice excels in above others?**

**A:** Crown and bridges. Cosmetics.

 

**Q: What are the best moments that make it worth it?**

**A:** I find the best reward is when a patient who has had a fear of the dentist that has led to lost oral health becomes comfortable with our office and allows us to help them to restore their health and self-confidence.
