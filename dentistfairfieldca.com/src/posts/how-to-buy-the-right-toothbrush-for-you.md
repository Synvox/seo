We don’t always have a toothbrush on hand, (though when you come in for a teeth cleaning, we give you one!). Sometimes we have to buy them and just don’t know what to get with all the different kinds.

Consider these factors and tips next time you get a toothbrush:

1. Every toothbrush you use needs to have soft bristles. Hard bristles damage gums and increase your sensitivity to heat, cold, and foods.

2. Consider getting a power toothbrush. Almost all of them time the 2 minutes you are meant to be brushing. If you have a hard time counting in your head or have a tendency to cut the time short, powered toothbrushes are worth the investment.

3. Powered toothbrushes have been found to get rid of plaque better than manual toothbrushes. They may be pricey but they last a long time and will ultimately be better for your oral health.

4. Replace your toothbrush and or toothbrush head every 3 or so months, when the bristles start looking frayed. Worn out brushes do very little to clean your teeth.

5. Make sure the size of the toothbrush head can fit easily in your mouth and can brush 1-2 sides of your teeth at once.



If you’re looking for your child, we recommend getting brushes that have smaller heads and bigger handles. Smaller heads are safer and less of a choking hazard. Bigger handles help them grip the brush better.



If you have any other questions, please ask at your next appointment and we can give

specific recommendations for your needs.
