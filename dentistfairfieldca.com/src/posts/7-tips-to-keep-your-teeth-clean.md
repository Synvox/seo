Brushing and going to the dentist at least twice per year is one of the best ways to keep your teeth clean. However, we can’t brush all the time, so here are seven tips that will help you keep your teeth clean each and every moment.

**Eat fruits** Fruits are great ways to clean your teeth at any time of the day. Even if they have sugar, you should know that the sugar in them is far less dangerous to your teeth than the sugar that comes from sweets and energy drinks.

**Floss** It’s really easy to floss, and you can take floss with you anywhere you go. Flossing regularly prevents food from getting stuck in between your teeth and hence keeps those cavities away.

**Enjoy calcium** Calcium is a great way of ensuring that your teeth stay strong and healthy. You can get it from yogurt, cheese and, of course milk. Eating a yogurt or having a glass of milk each day ensures your teeth health.

**Chew gum** The newer sugarless gums help clean your teeth. There is a wide variety of them available on the market, so pick the one that you like best. However, remember to pick a gum that’s approved by your dentist of has the label of approval from a dentist association. Tip: Look for the brands that use xylitol as a sweetener.

**Avoid drinking sodas** Drinking pop on a daily basis means damaging your teeth on purpose. It’s the fastest way to get discolored teeth and cavities, especially if you like colas. Avoid drinking them altogether, or at least stick to sugar free.

**Rinse regularly** A mouthwash is a great thing to have around. If you can’t use mouthwash, then rinse with water after you eat. This way, you make sure that the bigger pieces of food don’t get stuck in between your teeth.

**Remember to brush** Brushing once per day is good, brushing in the morning and the evening is recommended, and brushing after each meal is ideal.

Remember the above 7 tips to keep your teeth clean and you’ll always have healthy teeth and gums.
