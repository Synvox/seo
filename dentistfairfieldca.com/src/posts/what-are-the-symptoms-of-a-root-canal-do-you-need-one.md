There are a lot reasons our teeth can hurt, causing us pain, worry, stress, and many other side effects?  There’s cavities, gum disease, and even the need for root canals. Let’s take a look at the symptoms of possible root canals:

1. If you have a tooth this is discolored, often a darker color than the normal whitish-yellow range.
2. When you chew, you have severe pain in the from of a toothache.
3. A sensitivity to heat or cold foods or drinks.
4. A pimple that is on the gums of the pained tooth that has been there from while.
5. Swelling around the nearby gums.

We perform a root canal to try to save a tooth that’s badly decayed or infected. The pulp, or nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue of a tooth, has gotten too damaged to be repaired. A root canal gets that infected pulp out of the tooth and seals it off so no more damage can occur. Most teeth that have a root canal performed last your lifespan. 

If you have one or more symptoms, give us a call, so we can help you know your options and see if a root canal is what you need.
