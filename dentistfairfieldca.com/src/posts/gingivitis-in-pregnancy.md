[![gingivitis in pregnancy](/images/gingivitis-during-pregnancy-300x199.jpg)](/images/gingivitis-during-pregnancy.jpg)Gingivitis, more commonly known as an inflammation of the gums, is most often caused by the accumulation of plaque at the top of the teeth on the gum line. With the build-up of plaque, bacteria breeds and can lead to bone loss and tooth decay over time if it remains untreated. Gingivitis is a common condition and more than half of adults suffer from it. Pregnancy gingivitis, or an inflammation of the gums brought on by pregnancy, is also quite common among pregnant women and 7/10 pregnant women suffer from this. The shifting, increased hormones during pregnancy can cause an exaggeration in the way that your body deals with plaque levels in the mouth. Any excess plaque build-up may result in bleeding, tenderness, redness, or swelling that otherwise may have sparked no bodily response. Itâ€™s important to step up your oral hygiene routine during pregnancy to avoid developing pregnancy gingivitis and to quickly respond to the symptoms if they occur. Eating a healthy, balanced diet and avoiding sugary, sweet snacks is good practice in any case but it can also limit the accumulation of plaque along the gum line. Pregnant women should also brush at morning and night for at least two minutes each time with an anti-plaque toothpaste. Rinse with water after eating and brushing to flush out remaining bacteria and food particles from the hard to reach places and remember to include floss in your daily routine.
