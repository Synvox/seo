With so many options for toothpaste out there, it is no wonder that shopping for it can be super confusing. Picking the right one can be overwhelming once you step into that toothpaste aisle. What kind of toothpaste will be most beneficial to you?

The main feature of each toothpaste can be different, varying from brand to brand. However, there are a few common ones that you will find. These types of toothpaste all have their own qualities that may or may not help your specific needs.

**Whitening Toothpaste**

Toothpaste that is labeled for whitening usually has harsher materials than other toothpaste. These materials work to scrub surface stains gently. Some companies even use peroxide. These kinds of toothpaste, while they are popular, often cause tooth sensitivity. Since they are not recommended for children under 18, be sure to check with your dentist if you have any questions or concerns.

**Sensitivity Toothpaste**

Sensitivity toothpaste is used when you have a sensitivity to hot and/or cold. It is formulated especially for these individuals that are uncomfortable when eating or drinking certain things. Less abrasive and with chemicals that reduce sensitivity, sensitivity toothpaste does a great job at making you more comfortable. Inhibiting the ways that travel through the teeth to the nerves is their primary method.

**Children's Toothpaste**

If you do not already know, it is crucial that children have their own specialized toothpaste. This is because it contains less fluoride and comes in more kid friendly flavors. Less fluoride is better for kids because excessive amounts can stain the teeth. If you are unsure which toothpaste is best for your child, check with your family dentist.

**Tartar Control Toothpaste**

Those who are prone to tartar and its buildup will benefit greatly from toothpaste with tartar control. It contains ingredients that help to break down plaque before it hardens. Tartar control toothpaste is a great preventative measure, but will not prevent build up below the gum line.

**Ingredient Overvi****ew**

- Abrasive Agents
    - These substances are the scratchy ones that help to remove bacteria, minor stains, and food particles. One of these chemicals is calcium carbonate.
- Humectants
    - Moisturizing agents keep the toothpaste from drying out. A common ingredient used is glycerol.
- Thickeners
    - These give toothpaste its consistency and helps it to stay uniform, coming out of the tube easily.
- Detergents
    - The aspect of toothpaste, or any other cleaner that makes it foamy.
- Flavor
    - Flavored toothpaste usually has artificial sweeteners to make you want to use it more. These characteristics can vary from anything like cinnamon to bubble gum or lemon lime.

Getting the right toothpaste for you does not have to be that much of a chore. As long as you know what needs you have, you will be able to find something just right. Lastly, always ensure that the toothpaste that you end up buying is approved by the American Dental Association. Brush twice daily to encourage healthy habits in your kids as well!
