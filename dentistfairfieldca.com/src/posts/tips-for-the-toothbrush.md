Whatever kind of toothbrush you have, they all need to be cleaned and maintained so you aren’t putting a dirty toothbrush in your mouth to “clean” it. That makes sense right? If you feel like you need to do a little bit more for that toothbrush, here are some tips for cleaning and keeping minimal bacteria on it.

1. Make sure your toothbrush has room and time to dry. If you set it upside down or in another position, it may not air-dry completely, letting bacteria and germs grow on the wet bristles (ew). The same goes for moist and warm containers, like a toothbrush case, the toothbrush won’t dry completely, allowing germs to increase. 
2. If you have a window in the bathroom, use it. Sunlight helps dry the bristles of your toothbrush, but the rays also have some disinfecting qualities to help clean things.
3. You may feel like your  toothbrush needs some extra help. Hydrogen peroxide is a great solution. Use it by putting  the toothbrush, bristles down, in a small glass with the hydrogen peroxide, overnight and let it do the work. The solution will kill many of the germs and bacteria that grow on the brush.
4. Always remember to replace the toothbrush you are using. It is recommended to switch out a toothbrush every 3 to four months. Not just because of the wore-down bristles, but because bacteria has minimal time to grow on it.  Even if it’s just the toothbrush head you are replacing, you still need to do it.
5. If you want to get fancy, you can always have a night brush and a day toothbrush, so they can each dry and clean separately and you don’t wear them out as fast! If you need a new brush, it may be time for a cleaning, and we always give you a new one! You can even pick the color if you want ;)
6.  You can also purchase devices like Ultraviolet (UV) light sanitizers, to clean and sanitize your toothbrush/toothbrush head.
