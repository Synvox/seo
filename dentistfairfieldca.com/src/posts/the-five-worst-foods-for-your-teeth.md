[![Food to Avoid](/images/FoodstoAvoid.jpg)](/images/FoodstoAvoid.jpg)If you want to have a perfect smile, then you need to take care of it. As everybody knows the foods that we eat can lead to chipped teeth, cavities and other problems that make our smile less pleasant. So, let’s take a look at the top 5 worst foods for your teeth, as avoiding these can help you keep your smile bright and warm.

One of the first things that you need to avoid is **sugary drinks**. That’s especially hard since they’re so cheap and tasty, but remember that they’re full of sugar. Imagine how each time you take a sip out of a glass of lemonade, fruit juice, soda or even diet soda you give your teeth a sugar bath that leads to teeth erosion over time. If you can’t stop yourself from having these drinks, then have them with a meal as this will help counter balance the sugar and acid that you’re bathing your teeth in.

Stay away from **hard candy** at all costs. This is because it takes a really long time to dissolve in your mouth.  That means more time for the sugar to produce acid that is going to attack your teeth, and this causes cavities and tooth decay.

**Crackers** are surprise offenders, especially saltines and fish shaped crackers. These are made out of refined white flour and tons of genetically engineered ingredients that feed off the bacteria in your mouth. Plus, they stick to your teeth, creating pockets of thriving bacteria.

Take special care when eating a**cidic foods and citrus**, because when eaten alone they can wear the enamel on your teeth. So, always eat tomatoes, grapefruits, lemons alongside a meal to counteract the acid that they contain, if you want to keep your teeth healthy.

**Dried fruits** are considered healthy snacks. Kids are forced to eat them quite often but, the problem is that they stick to the teeth and they’re filled with sugar. Since they are sticky, they stay on the teeth for hours which let the bacteria eat through them slowly which translates into more chances for dental erosion to happen.  The acids in dried fruits also attack your teeth long after you stopped eating them, so, dried fruits should be avoided or eaten with something to counteract their effects, and ideally, you should brush after you’re done.

Keep these tips in mind and you’ll be able to keep your smile healthy and shiny for a long time. Avoid them, or you’ll end up at the dentist’s sooner than expected.
