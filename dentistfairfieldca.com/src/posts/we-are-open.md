We are pleased to announce that our doors are once again open. Back in business, finally! We are continuing with our normal hours. After these long few months, we all could use some help getting back on track. One way to do that is to book an appointment. If you’ve been putting off a tooth ache, chipped tooth, gums problems, or any other issue, please call us.

If you were due for a teeth cleaning these past few months, don’t forget to call and reschedule that. We recommend getting your teeth cleaned every 6 months, so those of you who missed it, don’t postpone!

As we enter this new phase of “normalcy”, we need to be careful of where we go, who we see, and what we touch. We are following the protocols and guidelines put out by the CDC, so rest assured we are doing all we can to see you (and our staff) safe from sickness. We encourage you wash your hands before and after coming to the office, avoid touching your face, and maintain a safe distance from others (6 feet apart). If you are still uncomfortable coming in, consider calling in and seeing what we can do for you! You can check our COVID-19 update page for more information on how we are taking extra precautions.

We also updated our website to be more mobile friendly and it’s looking great! So take a look!

Stay safe! Stay healthy!
