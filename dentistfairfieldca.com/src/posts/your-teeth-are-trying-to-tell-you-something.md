![](/images/the-dental-diet-book.jpg)In a new article by Anjula Razdan on the website, Experience Life, Steven Lin, DDS, holistic dentist and author of _The Dental Diet_, talks about the mouth–body connection and how nutrition can help address crooked teeth, your oral microbiome, and more.

“In society we see our dental health as more of an inconvenience or vanity factor than anything else,” Lin says. “But does anyone stop to think about why a hole formed in their tooth at all? Your teeth provide crucial signals from your body when it’s in distress and you’re not providing it the right material to be healthy.”
