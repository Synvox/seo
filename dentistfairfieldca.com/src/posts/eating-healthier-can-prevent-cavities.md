A study called _The Healthy Eating Index and Coronal Dental Caries in U.S. Adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2014_, was done to look at connections between untreated cavities, decayed, missing and filled teeth, and the Healthy Eating Index in almost 8,000 adults (20 years of age and older).

They found that those adults that took part in the study were less likely to have untreated coronal caries (cavities) than those that did not eat properly. These participants had the recommended amount of “fruits, greens, beans, and added sugars”. Decayed, missing, and filled teeth were also decreased when the Healthy Eating Index scores increased. The results were not consistent amount all ethnic and racial groups.

The researchers also gave advice to the dental professionals saying something to this affect: dietary counseling for caries prevention by dental professionals should incorporate comprehensive dietary guidelines that are consistent with those intended for enhancing overall health and reducing the risk of common systemic diseases.
