Pretty much all of the human race loves sugar. Pies, candy, chocolate, cookies, the list goes on and on. We know sugar isn’t great for our health because it can lead to diabetes, obesity, heart problems, etc. However, sugar can do more than just affect your physical health, it can mess with your oral health too. Drat! While treats are super yummy and should be enjoyed, we recommend eating it, with everything else, in moderation.

What does sugar to your teeth, gum, and overall oral health?

In simple terms, it causes cavities and tooth decay. In more of a detailed explanation, sugar is a fuel that bacteria in plaque uses as energy. After it’s used, the bacteria creates acid as an end product. That acid slowly build up and eat the enamel of the tooth, making holes, or cavities (dental caries) .

Unfortunately cavities can increase with age and sugar intake, the result also is not reversible. The younger generation is more at risk to get cavities from sugar than the older part of the population. According to actionsugar.org, “Plaque begins to build up on teeth only 20 minutes after we begin eating and if it is not removed effectively, tooth decay starts. People who regularly consume sugar have a higher risk of developing dental caries, particularly if the food they eat is sticky or consumed in between mealtimes. “

A couple ways to help lessen risk of cavities is to brush thoroughly twice a day, floss, reduce sugary snacks and drinks, and only eat sugary foods at mealtimes.

The recommendation from WHO ([WHO | World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/)) is for sugar intake to be kept below 5-10% our total energy (food) consumption.

Remember that this type of sugar is not connected to foods like whole fruits, or naturally occurring sugar. We are talking about added sugars!
