What To Do If You Have a Dental Emergency  

If you are in immense pain, you may be having a dental emergency. 

Step one is to contact us immediately. Sometimes if it’s serious enough, you can call the dentist’s personal number, especially after hours. The office staff will try to fit you in as quick as they can to help you out. They will come in any day of the week so that you can have relief as soon as possible. 


The dentist will often times prescribe medication for you over the phone so that you can last before your appointment if you have a few days. 
A couple examples of a dental emergency are a cracked tooth or
severe toothache.

Just remember this is what we do, we help people with tooth problems! Just call us and we can go from there.
