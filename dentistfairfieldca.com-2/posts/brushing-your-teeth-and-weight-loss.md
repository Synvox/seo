With the holidays coming up, many of us get carried away with how much food and sweets we eat, myself included (no one is perfect!). Did you know that if you brush your teeth close after dinner time, you may see the number on the scale go down? In a post by \[[Bonhappettee](https://bonhappetee.com)\] it showed that individuals that brushed their teeth right after dinner were more likely to not eat after, which causes them to be more mindful of what they eat instead of just putting one more piece of the cake, pie, or candy into their mouths. It even said an individual could lose up to 2kg (4.4lbs) in 6 months! Once you clean those pearly whites, you are likely to be more conscience about what you eat. It may be a really good dessert that you just canâ€™t resist that gets you to have to brush again that night, but that is ok. The power of the toothbrush is that you are going to think harder about what goes in, and that can help you to eat less in the long run. And who knows, maybe you will feel so good from skipping that midnight sugary snack, that you want to do more than just brush after dinner, you may even go to the gym! ![](/images/danil-aksenov-bkXzABDt08Q-unsplash-1024x1024.jpg) As always you, thank you for reading!
