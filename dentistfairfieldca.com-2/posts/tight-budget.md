Not everyone can walk into a dental office and plunk down a big stack of cash. We're not all wealthy celebrities who can pay for a Hollywood smile at the drop of a hat. In fact, far more people are on tight and strict budgets these days. These budgets rarely include extra money expenses that are unexpected. Teeth often fall into that category. Watch the following video to explore ways that you can take the best possible care of your teeth without spending a ton of money.

Can I get the care I need without breaking my bank account? Do I have to start counting every quarter and give up all of life's little pleasures to take care of my teeth? We certainly hope not. Financing your dental care can be accomplished many different ways, and we want you to know about all of them.

Many dentists have financing options. Dental insurance plans offer a number of ways in which they can help. With enough planning, research and strategy almost any financial issues can be overcome. We believe that you deserve the best possible smile along with the best dental care available. We hope this video will help you get exactly that.

Sincerely,

Mark J. Warner DDS Inc. “Life is Better with Great Teeth.”
