The month of September celebrates our gums and how to care about them.

What exactly are our gums? What do they do? Technically speaking, our gums, or gingiva is the connective tissue attached to and surrounding the necks of the teeth. They are covered with mucous membrane. Gums act as a sort of seal for our teeth. When they’re healthy and functioning properly, nothing can get in to harm the roots of our teeth. Gums also allow the teeth to be supported and stay in place.

A healthy pair of gums look pink and firm. If redness lines the teeth or there’s swelling, that’s common of unhealthy gums. Gums that bleed when you floss or brush your teeth are also likely to be weak.

One step to healthy gums is to do exactly that. Brush and floss your teeth! Simple! Other suggestions include regular cleanings at the dentist. Fluoride toothpaste and even toothpaste that specializes in gum health are great!

If you think you may have gum disease, it’s vital to get treatment ASAP. Some signs and symptoms include:

Pain and or sensitivity

Inflammation

Receding gums

Separation of teeth, or loosening teeth

Consistent bad breath

Gums that easily bleed
