Trick or Treating is one of the best and funnest times for a kid. Throughout the whole month of October, many kids think about what costume to wear, which doors to knock on, and what candy they’ll get.  

It’s a rite of passage they get to partake in every year.  While this year is a little bit of a special circumstance, kids will still get plenty of candy to enjoy.  As a parent, you want your children to enjoy the holiday, but not get a million cavities that you have to deal with later. Here are a few “tricks” to deal with those “treats”

1. If you go out with your kids, maybe go to fewer houses or stop after a certain amount of candy is collected.  Then they will have less to eat.
2. Another tip is to avoid candy that gets stuck in  and/or on the teeth. Candies such as gummy treats, taffy, toffee, and others, will be sitting in your child’s mouth all day and can be difficult to get off at night. This can lead tooth damage. 
3. Sour candy is very acidic, which can wear down enamel over time. If your child is a huge sour fan, try limiting sour candies.
4. Sugar free candies and gums can help produce more saliva in the mouth, aiding the removal of residue!

Have a fun and safe Halloween this year, even if it is a little different!
