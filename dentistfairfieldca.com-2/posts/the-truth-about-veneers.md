If you truly want to have that perfect smile, but your teeth are chipped, stained and you have big gaps between them, then an option to consider is veneers. These are a great and permanent way to change the aspect of your teeth and give yourself that amazing shiny white Hollywood smile that is so popular these days.

**What are veneers?**

![Veneers-Mark-J-Warner-DDS](/images/Veneers-Mark-J-Warner-DDS.jpg "Veneers Mark J Warner DDS")Veneers are little thin, colored shells that are used to cover the front of the teeth. They are applied individually by a dentist, and are great way to hide all those little imperfections. No matter if your teeth are stained or have little chips or discolorations, veneers are going to give you a great looking smile that you’ll be proud to show each and every chance you get.  However, one thing that you need to take under consideration is the fact that even if veneers look great when they’re applied by a professional, they are going to completely, and permanently, change the aspect of your teeth.

Of course, non-permanent dental veneers are also available. These dental veneers are molded to existing teeth and yet are removable and reusable.  They are made from a flexible resin material.  If you have ever seen a young pageant queen with perfect teeth, chances are she is wearing this type of veneers.

**What options do I have?**

When it comes to permanent veneers, there are two types: porcelain and composite resin. Usually, the porcelain veneers are the best choice as they outlast the composite resin veneers.  Truth be told, they tend to cost a little bit more. However, keeping in mind that you only apply them once and they last you for a very long time, they are a great investment.

You can apply as many veneers as you want. To make things perfectly clear, you can get one or more to cover the teeth that you want to hide.  But, you should remember that it is recommended to get them all at once.  The reason for this is because If you have them done over several appointments, your dentist might have trouble matching the exact color.

**How are veneers applied?**

When you go to the dentist, he or she is going to take impressions of your teeth. These impressions are going to be used as ways to design your veneers. After that, the dentist is going to file away some of your natural enamel. This is not a reversible step.  That’s why you want to make sure that you’re getting the veneers that you want and that you’re comfortable with them. The next step is to cement the veneers onto your teeth using a dental resin. Once that’s done, you can enjoy your new smile.
