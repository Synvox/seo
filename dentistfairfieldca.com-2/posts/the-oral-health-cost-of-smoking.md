Smoking causes damage to basically all parts of the body, but many people do not realize the effect it can have on Oral Health. Smoking causes periodontal disease, delay healing of the mouth, and increases the risk of oral cancer. Additionally, it worsens bad breath, and the stains that accumulate from smoking are generally tough to remove without the help of a dentist.

Smoking can contribute to these problems in the mouth:

- Discolored teeth
- Salivary gland inflammation
- Increased jaw bone loss
- Extra buildup of tartar and plaque
- More risk of gum disease, oral cancer, and periodontal disease

In addition to immediate benefits to your oral health, quitting smoking also reduces the risks high blood pressure, stroke, and lung cancer. Smokers who quit get to promptly see a whiter smile and better gum health.
