With all the news about the Coronavirus, we can’t forget about what our oral health can do for us. If we don’t have good oral health, it doesn’t just affect our mouths, it can affect our entire body, and even increase Covid-19 complications and severity. 


According to a[](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpe.13435) study with a sample size of more than 500 Covid-19 positive patients, it was found that those with gum disease were 3.5 times more likely to need intensive care and 4.5 times more like to need a ventilator. It was found that those with gum disease also were almost 9 times more likely to die than those without gum disease! That’s a shocking statistic. 

 The study suggests that the inflammation that comes from gum disease can spread to other parts of the body. The coronavirus attacks the lungs, which can cause an overactive immune response and increased inflammation. So if your body is already inflamed, you can be at a higher risk for severe Covid-19 complications.

\
Also, oral bacteria in gum disease patients, can be inhaled and infect the lungs, which is where Covid-19 attacks. 

 Almost half of adults get periodontitis, or gum disease, but it can be easily prevented with routine and lifelong dental care. If you think you have Periodontitis, please call us today.
