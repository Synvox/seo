First of all, it is important to know that dental disease can affect a developing baby.  Studies show that 18 out of every 100 premature births are caused by periodontal disease, chronic disease of the gums.  Babies who are born prematurely may risk a range of health conditions including cerebral palsy and problems with eyesight and hearing.  Proper dental treatment is needed to reduce the risk of premature birth.

Of course, pre-pregnancy health can be a good predictor of success later in your pregnancy.  Make sure you have a habit of brushing your teeth twice a day, flossing between your teeth, and seeing your dentist regularly.  Also, if you are experiencing problems, it is best to have your dentist take care of them before you conceive.  Otherwise, non-urgent issues can be taken care of during your first trimester.  Your dentist will likely put off anything that involves x-rays or anesthesia until after you deliver your baby.
