[](/images/SeeDentistEvery6Months.jpg)We all know that going to a dentist at least twice per year is recommended. But, why do we really want to do that? Why seeing a dentist every six months is important seems to evade most of us. While it is true that some people need to go to the dentist more often than others, the general rule is six months. So, why this rule?

Well, because the dentist, during the six month visit checks your teeth for tooth decay, evaluates the health of your gums, and examines the mouth for any indications of diabetes, vitamin deficiencies or oral cancer. The dentist or dental hygienist might also examine the face, the bite and the movement of the lower jaw joints. Not such a big deal right? It’s a regular check up to make sure everything is fine.

What happens next is also very easy for you, as the dentist will clean the teeth and give you tips on how to keep your teeth healthy. Of course, this is of everything is in order.

The main idea behind going to the dentist two times per year is that you can prevent lots of problems that can cost you a lot of money to fix. Truth be told, it’s really not very profitable for dentists to provide the check-up, as they can get lots more money leaving problems worsen and then wait for you to pay them to have them fixed.

That’s why, it’s recommended to really go to the dentist two times per year: you make sure that whatever problems you have you treat them in due time as you can prevent their worsening. What would you rather have? To clean a small cavity or to replace a tooth?  Obviously the first option isn’t only the cheapest, but it’s also the one that’s more painless and less time consuming.

Now you see why seeing a dentist every six months is important. And the truth is that it’s more important for you than for the dentist from a monetary point of view. However, it can be invaluable for you from a tooth-health point of view.

So, you want to make sure to take the time and go to the dentist two times per year – to save yourself lots of problems later. If you don’t do this, you only have to lose quite a lot of time and money. Not only that, but you could potentially be in a lot of pain.
