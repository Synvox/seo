![dentist-fairfield-ca-new-approach-peridontitis](/images/dentist-fairfield-ca-new-approach-peridontitis-300x220.jpg)As periodontitis becomes more widespread in America, researchers seek new approaches to reducing the amount of harmful bacteria in the oral cavity, including inherently-antibiotic materials. Researchers working at the Kyoto Institute of Technology documented an antibacterial effect of silicon nitride – a hard, biocompatible ceramic – on P. gingivalis, a bacterial species implicated in periodontal disease.

Usually used for industrial applications such as bearings and high-temperature-resistant propulsion components, silicon nitride is two points behind diamond on the Mohs hardness scale.
