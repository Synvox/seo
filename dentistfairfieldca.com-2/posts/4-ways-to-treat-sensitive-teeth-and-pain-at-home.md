Occasionally we get sensitive teeth, or sometimes we are just prone to having tooth sensitivity constantly. If either is you, try some of these tips and let us know if they help you!

1. Vanilla Extract. Yes, you read that right! The common baking ingredient has antiseptic and analgesic (pain relief) properties. Isn’t that cool? Vanilla extract is typically found in anyone’s kitchen, making it really easy to try out. Make sure it is pure, as the imitation may not work or be as effective.  How to use: apply some vanilla extract to a cotton ball, or a cotton swab, and put on the irritated gums or teeth. You can do this as often as needed. It is recommended to leave there for a few minutes before removing. 


2. Honey and warm water rinse. Honey has antibacterial properties that help to aid healing, reducing pain, swelling, and inflammation.  How to use: Rinse your mouth with some warm water and and a spoonful of honey. Simple as that.


3. Desensitizing toothpaste. This is a common one that you can look for at the store. There are many brands, but a well-known one is called Sensodyne®. These toothpastes work to protect nerve endings, making your brain not as susceptible to the pain. 
4.  Salt water rinse. Another household ingredient is salt, which can help fight inflammation.  How to use: Twice daily, gargle 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoons in a glass of warm water for at least 30 seconds. 

   As always, if the pain is great enough, give us a call and we can help! Make an appointment today!
