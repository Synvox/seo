Have you tried? How do you tell if your dentist is the best dentist in Fairfield, CA? Obviously, the answer is highly subjective and dependent on many different factors.

First of all, there are many dentists in Fairfield, CA. And they come in many different types. There are family dentists, pediatric dentists, general dentists, and [cosmetic dentists](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/cosmetic-dentistry-fairfield-ca/). Most general dentists will also be able to provide cosmetic dentistry and [implant dentistry](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/implant-dentistry-dental-implants/), but not all of them have the same skill level.

So, of all the dentists in Fairfield, who is the best? We think that it has a lot to do with the way the patient feels after he or she has seen the dentist. For instance, if your child comes away from a pediatric dentist more afraid than when they came in, that could be a red flag. However, if your child is more comfortable with the dentist each time he or she visits, you know that the dentist has done a good job.

Also, a dentist does not have to be able to handle every type of dental case to be the best, although it certainly helps if they are good at the basics. Things like tooth extraction, fillings and restoration work, and dental bridges form some of the most fundamental dental work. If the dentist is able to do excellent work in those areas, they can always add [teeth whitening](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/cosmetic-dentistry-fairfield-ca/), [dental implants](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/implant-dentistry-dental-implants/), and even [Invisalign clear wireless braces](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/invisalign-clear-wireless-braces-fairfield-ca/) to their professional mix.

A good dentist should be versatile in their treatment plans. If they are unable to provide a certain service in office, they should be able to refer their patients to a competent alternate provider. The best dentists have developed a network of recommended providers they can use in these circumstances, as well as for times when they will be out of the office for an extended time.

Finally, the best dentist in Fairfield, CA will have the best dental staff. From the first contact with the front desk to the moment you exit the dental chair, you should be made to feel comfortable. Most dentist will take care to hire only people who are friendly and courteous, from their receptionists to their dental hygienists. This ensures a seamless, pleasant experience.
