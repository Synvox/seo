 You’ve heard of Oral Cancer, or mouth cancer, but what is mouth cancer action month?

Mouth Cancer Action Month is a charity campaign organised by the Oral Health Foundation. Taking place throughout November, the campaign raises awareness of mouth cancer and shares the important message of being mouthaware. ([Mouth Cancer Action Month 2021 | Oral Health Foundation](https://www.dentalhealth.org/mouthcanceractionmonth2021) You probably haven’t heard of it because the charity is from the UK. However, that doesn’t mean we aren’t taking part. 
Mouth cancer takes more lives than cervical and testicular cancer combined. 

Here are some ways you can take part this month!

1. Knowing how to spot it can help save lives. Regularly checking your mouth for unusual spots, or changes in your mouth can really make a difference.  (i.e. mouth ulcers, white or red patches in the mouth, lumps, or constant hoarseness.)
2. IF you find any, immediately call your dentist.
3. Understanding the likely causes of mouth cancer can help you avoid the risk of getting it. 

Most cases involve the use of tobacco and or alcohol. That means chewing tobacco and smoking it. Alcohol also increases the risk of getting a type of mouth cancer.  Another surprising cause can be HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV spreads through oral sex. It affects the skin that lines moist parts of the body, as in your mouth!

If you feel so inclined to help even more, check out the website and donate to the cause. The goal is to reduce mouth cancer!
