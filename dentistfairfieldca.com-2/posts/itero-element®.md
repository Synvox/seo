This cool gadget is only one tool that Dr. Warner uses to help your oral health. This tool is special for a few reasons:
The iTero Element® is a scanner created by the makers of Invisalign® to work with you personally. It uses your teeth in a 3D virtual manner to show how your smile can look during and after your treatment. It is specific to your own smile and mouth. Patients have loved seeing their own mouth, helping them visually know what their smile can really look like!
The iTero Element ® takes 6,000 images per second and allows you to see your progress at each appointment.

If you are considering Invisalign, you really should use this great scanner to see the potential of your great smile, before you go through the whole treatment!
