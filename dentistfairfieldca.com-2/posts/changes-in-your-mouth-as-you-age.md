As we age, the condition of our teeth is even more important. Although the mouth undergoes some change as we age, losing your teeth does not have to be one of them. Teeth can usually be kept for a lifetime with proper care.

Drinking tap water can be beneficial for the teeth no matter what your age; most municipal water is fluoridated and will help to prevent cavities. Fluoride can also be easily found in most toothpastes as well as dental rinses.

If you have Diabetes, gum disease can be more common than usual. Getting regular cleanings at the dentist is recommended to help identify and halt tooth and gum problems. Diabetes and oral health also connect in that treating gum disease can improve the management of blood sugar levels, but Diabetes also means a lower resistance to infection and increased oral healing times.

If you have lost some teeth, cleaning your dentures well is a must for a healthy mouth. Washing dentures removes food from them in the same way as it does for natural teeth. Brushing your gums gently using a soft toothbrush before inserting your dentures is good for promoting circulation and to remove plaque from surfaces in your mouth.

Maintaining a healthful diet can be a definite contributing factor in keeping your teeth as you age. Minerals and vitamins from fruits and vegetables are important as well as drinking a good amount of water. Eating snacks throughout the day can reduce the effectiveness of your saliva and lead to tooth decay.

Getting older can mean that your gums may recede, or teeth can become yellowed or discolored (brown) with age. Whitening techniques as well as restoration of oral tissues can help rejuvenate these aspects of an older mouth.
