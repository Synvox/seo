Invisalign®
Want straighter teeth without braces? We can do that too! Introducing Invisalign clear wireless braces. An alternative to metal braces, these flexible appliances have distinct benefits over traditional orthodontics.
Invisalign® acts like braces, straightening your teeth, but you don’t have to see them. Wear them all day, and no one will even notice! And you don’t get food stuck in them, which is always a plus.

[image:(null)/(null)]The first thing we will do when we see you in our Fairfield office is to determine if Invisalign is right for you. This will also be your opportunity to ask any questions about Invisalign, costs, dental/orthodontic insurance, or any other concerns.

If you decide to move forward, we will use [the new iTero Element® scanner](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/invisalign-clear-wireless-braces-fairfield-ca/introducing-our-new-itero-element-scanner/) to create a digital 3-D image of your teeth. Using this image we will map out a precise treatment plan, including the precise movements of your teeth. We will even be able to show you a virtual representation of how your teeth will progress at each stage of your treatment plan.

A series of custom-made, clear aligners will be created specifically for you, according to your treatment plan. These aligners will be made of a smooth, BPA-free plastic that is much more comfortable than traditional metal braces. All you have to do is wear them throughout the day, removing them only to eat or to brush and floss your teeth. For best results and a timely outcome, we recommend that you wear your aligners for 20 to 22 hours per day. Gradually, your teeth will gently begin to shift into place. Most people won’t even notice you’re wearing them!

You will receive a new set of aligners about every 2 weeks, designed to advance you to the next stage of your treatment. We will need to see you every six weeks or so to check your progress. Before long (about a year for adults and slightly longer for teens) you will have the smile of your dreams.
