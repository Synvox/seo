Toothbrushing is one of the most important things you can do twice a day. But how can you be sure you are brushing in all the right places? Tiny grooves and hard-to-reach-back teeth make plaque build-up almost inevitable, leading to tartar formation. Use this guide to check on the places you just might be missing.

Gums

Our teeth get so much attention during brushing that often the gumline is overlooked. But the area where the teeth meet the gums is a common place for food and bacteria to be trapped. Most oral care professionals recommend angling your toothbrush downward at a 45-degree angle and brushing gently to help prevent cavities and gum disease.

Tongue

You may not realize it, but your tongue is a giant harbor for bacteria. Cleaning it is easy. Remembering to clean it--not so much. Starting at the back of your tongue, brush forward toward the tip. Then rinse your mouth. You don't need a lot of pressure to remove the food particles and other nasties trapped there in the mucus on the surface of your tongue.

Behind the Front Teeth

While most people realize that brushing all sides of the molars is important, they may forget that the back sides of their front teeth. These include incisors, canines, and laterals, and can be an easy place for plaque to hide. It will take some maneuvering with your toothbrush, but once you get in the habit of focusing your brushing in these areas, you won't have that fuzzy feeling with the tip of your tongue.

Of course, regular visits to your dentist will help support your oral care routine and are necessary to remove the tartar build-up that happens when plaque stays in an area for too long.
