Charcoal has been a very popular trend this past year? But why? Is it because it seems like such an unlikely thing to use on your teeth or even skin? Whatever the reason is for its popularity, let’s take a look at the pros and cons for using it as toothpaste. PROS While it isn’t proven to actually whiten teeth, there are some possible benefits to using it: \* it may help bad breath \* it can possibly protect against staining of teeth if used occasionally after a professional cleaning CONS \* most brands of charcoal toothpaste don’t contain fluoride (a chemical that helps prevent tooth decay and cavities \* it may wear down tooth enamel and might make your teeth look yellow \* if used everyday, it can cause tooth sensitivity \* since it’s popularity has not been long-term, it’s effects and safety over time are not well known, so it can be risky to use too often.

Overall, use charcoal toothpaste occasionally and see if it helps your teeth! Just be wary of all the claims being made about it, and be careful not to use it everyday! And remember that every person is different, so it may affect individuals in different ways. If you do use it, make sure you get enough fluoride in your water and or, other ways to make certain you are getting that protection against cavities and tooth decay!
