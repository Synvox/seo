![Man with a toothache. Pain in the human body](/images/dentist-fairfield-ca-impacted-wisdom-teeth-300x200.jpeg)Are you experiencing throbbing jaw pain or pain in the back of your mouth, inflammation and bleeding of the gums behind your molars, swollen glands in your neck and shoulders, and headaches radiating from your jaw? You may have impacted wisdom teeth. If so, the problem is only going to get worse.

Impacted wisdom teeth cause pain as they push on the nerves and bone in your jaw. But other complications can arise that are far more serious. According to [Dental Vibe](https://www.dentalvibe.com/warning-signs-impacted-wisdom-teeth/), impacted wisdom teeth can lead to:

Damage and realignment of adjacent teeth. Impacted wisdom teeth can push on the teeth around them, causing infection or forcing the teeth out of place.

Gum disease. Impacted wisdom teeth are prone to infection and decay. This can cause serious issues in the mouth. Because the back portion of the gums are difficult to clean as is, this can result in food and bacteria becoming trapped and lead to further gum disease and tooth decay.

Cysts. Wisdom teeth grow within a sac that is located in the interior of the jaw. These sacs can fill with fluid when wisdom teeth become impacted, which can lead to cysts that can damage nerves, cause pain and cause damage to adjacent teeth.

If you think you may have impacted wisdom teeth or any other problem of the teeth and gums, contact you dentist to schedule an appointment. You will be glad you took the time to relieve the pain you are feeling and prevent other problems down the road.
