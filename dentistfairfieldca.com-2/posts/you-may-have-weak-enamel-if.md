Weak enamel can cause serious problems in your mouth. After all, it is the enamel that protects your teeth from hot and cold temperatures, staining, and tooth decay. Enamel is also one of the strongest substances in our body, so if it is weak, it can lead to nerve damage in your teeth and other serious issues. 

 Signs that you may have weak enamel -

 Transparent-looking teeth

 Rounded teeth

Cracks or chips in teeth 

Intense pain in tooth/teeth 

Frequent tooth aches

Sensitivity to hot or cold foods/drinks
