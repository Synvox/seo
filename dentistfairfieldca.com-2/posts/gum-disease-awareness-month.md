The month of February each year is about raising awareness and knowledge about gum disease. So we wanted to share some facts and wisdom about gum disease so anyone can spot it and prevent it.  Gum disease is called a few different things depending on the severity. So letâ€™s look at the stages:

1. Healthy gums- no sign of gum disease in the mouth- looking good, keep it up!
2. Gingivitis- plaque build up on the teeth. Calcium from our saliva can create calcified, or really hard, plaque called tartar. Germs that live in this plaque can damage the gum tissue.
3. Periodontitis- Untreated gingivitis will become periodontitis. That tartar, or calculus, can expand on the tooth and down into//under the gum line. When this happens, your gums separate slightly from your teeth forming /pockets./ If the pockets deepen, it can cause your teeth to loosen and or fall out.  (advanced periodontitis)

The biggest cause of gum disease is poor dental hygiene, like not flossing and brushing your teeth every day. It can allow that plaque to build up and your gums to become inflamed. 

Family history, genetics, and even having other disease are some other risk factors associated with gums disease.  If you would like to know more, ask Dr. Warner or one of our hygienists at your next appointment.
