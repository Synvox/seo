How to choose the best dentist is not usually a topic of conversation around the dinner table. In fact, it's not a topic that is often discussed at all. Let’s face it, discussing good and bad dentists, their features and attributes, is not necessarily the best dinner conversation.

However, making the right choice for you and your family's oral health is absolutely critical. This is especially true with the wide variety of types of dentists and dental specialists such as [cosmetic dentists](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/cosmetic-dentistry-fairfield-ca/), family dentists, [implant dentists](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/implant-dentistry-dental-implants-fairfield-ca/), orthodontists, periodontists, sedation dentists and a number of others.

Take a look at this video that will provide you with helpful clues on how to go about choosing the right dentist.

What if all you need is a simple [teeth cleaning](https://www.dentistfairfieldca.com/teeth-cleaning-and-restoration/)? Obviously that’s not the same thing as having a tooth pulled. What if you have a more serious problem, such as a root canal or a broken tooth? Again, that’s quite different from having a toothache. What if you needed very advanced treatments such as reconstructive surgery or to replace an entire mouth full of old fillings? It's so important to make the right selection, which is why we prepared this video for you.

We hope this helps and look forward to serving you further.

Yours sincerely,
