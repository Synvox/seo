When you break a bone or have an injury, you often get an x-ray to see the area better. The same idea goes for dental x-rays. They are images of your teeth to look at things like cavities, tooth decay, and other potential problems that occur in your mouth.  The images usually consist of different angles of your mouth, to get the best picture of your current oral health.  While big pieces of special paper go in your mouth, the process is simple, quick, and painless. 

If there are any underlying problems that come to light from an X-ray, then you may need to get more in the future to track the progress, but typically you get X-rays once to twice a year, at your teeth cleanings. The dentist can then look at any cavities they need to fill and any other issues that need to be addressed.

While dental X-rays do emit radiation, that radiation is so low, that is considered safe for children, adults, and even pregnant women. (Make sure your dentist knows you are pregnant if you are, because they may postpone if they feel it is needed.) The bib or blanket you put on helps to limit the exposure to any radiation, so don’t sweat.  The health risks of possible oral problems are probably greater than the low dose of radiation you would get from an X-ray.
If you haven’t gotten an x-ray of your teeth, considering coming in to make sure you’re healthy!
