When you have a missing tooth and you want to fill the gap, you get a bridge. That bridge is a fake tooth, or teeth depending on how large the gap is. When you have two real teeth, with one gap, they just put in a fake tooth. That is the simple answer!

Are Dental Bridges Permanent? 

Dental bridges can be either temporary or permanent depending on the individual’s case. Most bridges last around 5-15 years, and some require getting replaced. 

How do you take care of Dental Bridges? 

You will want to know this if you ever get one. Maintaining a dental bridge can prolong its life, saving you time and money.
Luckily, it’s not much different from the normal oral routine. 
Here is a quick list that comes from [News Medical](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20170922/Care-for-Dental-Bridges.aspx):

* Brush teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste
* Floss with care daily between natural teeth and underneath the bridge
* Rinse teeth with a fluoride wash regularly if desired
* Have teeth professionally cleaned by a dentist or dental hygienist regularly
* Attend regular dental check-ups to assess the health of the bridge
